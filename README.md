## ✨ About the Project

This project aims to bring the fun and simplicity of the "Go Fish!" card game to a digital platform. We're focusing on creating an engaging and intuitive experience for players of all ages.

## 📜 Coding Standards

We are committed to maintaining a clean and well-structured codebase by adhering to the following principles:

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Utilizing classes and objects to model the game elements and logic.
* **Strong Cohesion:** Ensuring that classes and modules have a single, well-defined responsibility.
* **Loose Coupling:** Minimizing dependencies between different parts of the system to improve maintainability and flexibility.
* **Encapsulation:** Hiding the internal details of classes and exposing only necessary interfaces to the user.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

This project is being built using the following tools and technologies:

* **NetBeans:** Our primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
* **Visual Paradigm:** Used for UML modeling and design.
* **GitHub:** For version control and collaboration.

## 🚀 Future Plans

While the project is currently a work in progress, we have exciting plans for the future, such as:

* Implementing a single-player mode against an AI opponent.
* Developing a multiplayer mode for playing with friends online.
* Creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
* Adding customizable game settings.
