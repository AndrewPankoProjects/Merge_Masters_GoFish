## ✨ About the Project

This project successfully brings the fun and simplicity of the "Go Fish!" card game to a digital platform. We've focused on creating an engaging and intuitive experience for players of all ages.

This project was built using the following tools and technologies:

* **NetBeans:** Our primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
